# Carbon-Plugs
A Collection of Plugins created for the Carbon Mod on Rust

They are probably all stupid and only here for giggles

Drop the plugin into your Carbon/Plugins folder and enjoy.

Remember the Plugins are MIT meaning you can copy/sell/change as you please BUT... they have to include the original MIT licence.
If you don't I will DMCA your butt! :P
